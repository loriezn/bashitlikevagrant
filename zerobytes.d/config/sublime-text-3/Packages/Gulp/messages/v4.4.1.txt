Hello!

New command! if you forget to kill your running tasks before exiting Sublime Text, now you can use `gulp_exit`.

This command will close Sublime Text, but first it'll kill any running tasks. It's the same as running `Gulp: Kill running tasks` and immediately exiting the editor.
If no running tasks are found or an error occurs killing them, the editor will close anyways.

You can select `Gulp: Exit editor killing running tasks` on the command palette or create a keybinding like this:

    { "keys": ["KEYS"], "command": "gulp_exit" }

You can bind it to `alt+f4` or `super+q` so you don't have to remember it. Sadly it won't run if you close the editor using the close button and Sublime doesn't provide a callback for that.

If you find any problem or you have a feature request you can do so at https://github.com/NicoSantangelo/sublime-gulp/issues

Thanks to @dirad for the idea.
