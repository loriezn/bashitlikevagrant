Hello!

The latest version of sublime-gulp now has support for command flags (arguments)!

If you want to run a gulp task with a flag like `--watch` or even `--version` you can set it on the settings file or on a specific keybinding. For more info take a look at the README here: https://github.com/NicoSantangelo/sublime-gulp#settings

If you're using flags right now and this implementation does not solve your particular workflow, let me know!

As always, if you find any problem or you have a feature request you can do so at https://github.com/NicoSantangelo/sublime-gulp/issues

Thanks a lot to @vitalybe and @cperryk for the feature request.
