Recent Changes
==============

Hello!

Sublime gulp just got a bunch of new stuff!

1) You can now run any task without having to pick from your predefined gulpfile list. So you can add flags, or just run `gulp -v` if you want.
Give it a try selecting `Gulp: Run arbitrary task`, more info: https://github.com/NicoSantangelo/sublime-gulp/tree/release#available-commands

2) The package now has support for babel using a `gulpfile.babel.js` file. Thanks @peduxe for the heads up!.

3) Support for running gulp using require-dir or a gulpfile.js dir has been added!
The only caveat for now is that if you use a `gulpfile.js` that only contains:

`require('require-dir')('build/tasks');`

The .sublime-gulp.cache will not be automatically regenerated if you make a change on any of your task files, you'll need to delete the cache (`Gulp: Delete cache`) before running `Gulp` again.

Thanks a lot to everyone who helped with this one, @dkebler, @cksachdev, @ISkomorokh.

4) Context menus!
